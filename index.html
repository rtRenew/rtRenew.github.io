        <h1 class="pageHeader">Our Mission Statement</h1> 
        <p class="pageCol">RT Renewables, based in Halifax West Yorkshire, was founded to provide an accessible means of adding photovoltaic (solar) power to homes and businesses across the district, spreading the benefits of renewable energy as we go. After all, not every business can say their work saves people money and eases the pressures of rising energy bills, all while having a positive effect on climate change and carbon emissions.</p>
        <p class="pageCol">Most solar panels have a reasonable life expectancy of up to 25 years, and the cost of installation often offset against the savings on energy bills within 7 years. This means up to 18 years of pure savings, and that&#39;s before considering any value they may add to your home.</p>
        <p class="pageCol">Our work is completed by MCS accredited installers and is compliant with local requirements. We pride ourselves on working cleanly and efficiently to minimise the disruption to your home during the install, and once finished, your PV system will serve you well for years to come.</p>
        <p class="pageCol">If you&#39;d like to know more, contact us now to discuss your needs, or for a no obligations quote.</p>
