                    <h3 class="serviceHead">Solar Installation</h3>
                    <p class="serviceText">A Solar PV (photovoltaic) system can be added to your home, most commonly on the roof, to capture energy from the sun and convert it into usable power for your home. As an indicative value, a 4kW solar system is considered enough to meet the needs of a 3-4 person household. 
                        <br>Most solar systems have a life expectancy of 25 years, and pay for themselves in less than half this time. Whilst there is equipment involved beyond the panels themselves, such as batteries and inverters, this can often be installed in discrete locations such as loft space, garages, or even the exterior of the property. 
                        <br>As an added bonus, feed in tariffs offer the option to sell surplus power back to the grid. So not only can you save on energy bills and help the environment, you can be paid for your efforts too.

                    <h3 class="serviceHead">Heat Pump Installs</h3>
                    <p class="serviceText">A heat pump is designed to capture heat from outside a property and move it inside. This increasingly popular option works with the vast majority of existing interior heating such as underfloor heating and radiators. As an added bonus, a heat pump is installed on the exterior of a building, which means it avoids taking up valuable space in your home. 
                        <br>Many models include ways of dealing with icing issues that can occur in winter, and studies have found that in optimal conditions a heat pump can produce 300% the energy it consumes, making it more efficient than traditional furnaces. This leaves a heat pump as a solid option to improve your home&#39;s energy efficiency, and help the environment along the way.

                    <h3 class="serviceHead">Property Insulation</h3>
                    <p class="serviceText">For many homes, poor insulation or not being insulated can lead to up to 45% of your home&#39;s heat being lost, which in turn can lead to higher energy bills.
                        <br>Insulation is designed to help control the transfer of heat, which means that your house will keep more of it&#39;s heat in winter. It also means that it will be slower to heat up from the sun in summer, helping to keep things comfortable all year around. 
                        <br>Fixing insulation issues is often seen as one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing energy waste, which is good for both your pocket and the environment. Whether it&#39;s cavity insulation or loft insulation, our team of specialists can handle jobs of any size.

                    <p class="serviceText">As electric vehicles become more and more common, the ability to keep them charged becomes ever more important. 
                        <br>Rather than sitting at a charging station waiting for the battery to charge, having a charging station added to your home offers the convenience of charging your car from the comfort of your couch. With options available for wall mounted or pedestal mounted chargers, there is enough flexibility to suit almost any home. 
                        <br>If you&#39;re not sure whether this would benefit you, get in touch and let one of our experts work it out for you.
